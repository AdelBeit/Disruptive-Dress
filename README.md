# Disruptive Dress

An interactive dress which provokes the wearer to move and engage the bystanders through passive and active motions. Specifically, it will “disrupt” the wearer, if they remain inactive for too long, through self animation, as signal the wearer of their sourroundings through passive sensors.

Objective
---
The goal of this project is to explore movement as input and output in interactive wearables; Through motors, passive sensors, and other such wearable electronics.

Orthographic Drawings

#### Drawing #1:

- The dress, with the feather kinetic collar, showing how the feathers on the collar will flip up and down in response to input from the muscle sensors.
- Dress also has embedded sonar sensor in the front, and vibration motors in the back.
- The dress has an overskirt that attaches at the belt. The overskirt has servos that pull on elastic strings, shifting the fabric. The overskirt also has shape changing wires that lift up fabric in the skirt.

#### Drawing #2:

- Shoes that contain the accelerometer that will serve as input to controlling the kinetic overskirt.

Wearable technologies we explored
---

- Memory wire: Wire that can remember its shape and self-bend to its original shape when subjected to heat.
- Vibro motor: Motor that vibrates
- Servo: Motor with limited range of rotation (typically 180deg) but with precise angular and speed control.
- Sonar Sensor: Sensor that detects objects using soundwaves.
- Muscle Tension Sensor: Sensor that senses tension in muscles
- Accelerometer: Sensor that measures acceleration or changes in velocity in a specific direction. It can be used to detect changes in motion, orientation, and vibration.
- Thermistor: Temperator sensor that changes its resistance with changes in temperature.
- Bluetooth module: Module that can be connected to a microcontroller to enable wireless communication through bluetooth technology.
- Microcontroller: Small computer on a single integrated chip. Used for controlling and monitoring electronic devices in small scale settings such as  IOT, robotics, medical devices, wearable technologies, etc...


Extension:
---

We plan on continuing this project by making an interactive shoe, time permitting.
